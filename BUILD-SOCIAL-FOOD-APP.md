## You the One to Launch The Next Billion Dollar Startup?

*Why building a food app?*

More and more people take care of what they are eating.
It's fashion, it's important, it's primordial.
Building something great around food and lifestyle and one the the greatest niche for 2018-2020.

## Healthy Food has never been so important!
People are paying more and more attention to their diet! And food is the MAINSTREAM thing.


# A FoodApp..., Like what...?

## The Tinder of the Food! Oh, Yeah!

You can for example, building a tinder app for food.
Users would swipe food items and filter food items per category (vegan, meat, vegetarian, allal, ...).
The app can even recommend the user to the nearest restaurant that matches to its criteria.

## The Instagram of Foodstuffs

Although Instagram has a LOT of food channels, it is not a niched photo sharing platform only for food items.
And it already demonstrates that people LOVE sharing food.

So, you have a HUGE opportunity to build an niche Instagram for sharing instantly the food you eat right now with your friends with short GIF food. For example, every time I go to a coffee shop (in fact, few times per day), I take a photo of my latte and my cake loaf. BELIEVE me!, if you build something similar, you will already get me on your platform! :)

## The Food Scanner

Brands are clever enough (or stupid enough) to write ingredients in VERY small characters.
For older people (or even younger), it became really hard and tedious to read them.

Why not to build a food scanner app that gives in a pleasant way everything the consumer wants to know (calories, ingredients, allergy, etc) The consumer will just have to download once the app on his phone and then, scan the barcode of any items to have the result showed nicely (with graph, chart, images). In short, your app will displayed all product's information in a much better and pleasant way than it is written on the product.

To help building a such app, you have already great databases (some are free) containing millions of items' information.


## The TripAdvicer for Food!

You already have apps that give recommendations for restaurants, hotels, etc (such as tripadviser), but there aren't such thing for foodstuffs. Why not to offer to customers to rate any food items they buy (with ratings, reviews, price-quality).
